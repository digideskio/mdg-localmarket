Local Market
============

Local Market is an open source app powered by Meteor and made by [Percolate Studio](http://percolatestudio.com). In this example app we explore intermediate techniques:

  - Using a sample database to generate lists and items

  - Cordova integration to use device phone and GPS
  - Mobile UI & UX

Further development has moved to the official Meteor [repo](https://github.com/meteor/localmarket)
